																					<strong>Timing of fertility treatments for women</strong>
																				</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">Treatments for improving fertility should be aiming at three to six full menstrual cycles. If a patient does not have regular period patterns or has complications such as a high FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) level and irregular
																					ovulation, PCOS and endometriosis, the patient will usually need to have more regular treatment sessions. Fertility treatment in my practice is often carried out in a combination of three to four acupuncture sessions a month together
																					with Chinese herbs to optimise the effectiveness of the overall fertility treatment.</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">Fertility treatment for women using Chinese medicine is usually divided into four phases with a different emphasis on each stage (based on a 28 day cycle):</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just"> • period (from Day 1 - Day 4): to help the menstrual flow and to encourage the complete discharge of menstrual blood so that a new endometrium can grow evenly on a smooth base
																					<br /> • post-period (Day 5 - Day 12): to build up blood and essence, and to begin to prepare the body for ovulation
																					<br /> • ovulation (Day 12 - Day 16): to promote the movement of Qi (vital energy) &amp; blood in the uterus for effective ovulation
																					<br /> • post-ovulation (Day 17 - Day 25): to maintain healthy levels of progesterone and warmth in the uterus
																					<br />
																				</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">Ideally, weekly visits to the clinic for acupuncture and Chinese herbs are recommended for women of 35 and over, or for women with a history of difficulty in conceiving (more than two years). </p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">Patients will be asked to take a BBT (Basal Body Temperature) chart throughout the course of their treatments to monitor the timing of ovulation and to check the overall progress of the treatments.</p>

																				<p class="text_main_just">Male infertility accounts for
																					<strong>thirty percent</strong> of infertility. To determine male fertility, semen analysis is often performed. The normal semen parameters according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) are as follows:</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">• Volume: more than 1ml
																					<br /> • Count: more than 20 million sperm per ml
																					<br /> • Motility: more than 50% progressively motile
																					<br /> • Morphology: more than 14% normal appearance</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">Another way of assessing male fertility is to undertake retrospective studies of couples achieving or not achieving pregnancy. When a large population of men was studied, those who had succeeded in fathering a child in the previous two
																					years had more than
																					<strong>48 million sperm</strong> per ml, with more than
																					<strong>63% moving</strong>, and more than 12% with normal morphology.
																					<span class="refs_numbers">3</span>
																				</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just">There are many contributing factors leading to male fertility problems, including hormonal dysfunction, fever or infection, especially prostatitis, epididymitis or orchitis, medical drugs, caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, recreational
																					drugs, poor diet, tight underwear and environmental chemicals.</p>

																				<p class="text_main_just">The average success rate after one cycle of IVF treatment in the UK is:</p>
																				<p class="text_main_just"> • 28% for women who are under 35 years of age,
