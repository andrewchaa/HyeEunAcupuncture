                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I started seeing Hye-Eun after I was recommended by friends. My partner and I had been trying to <strong>conceive</strong> for 1 year. I am 40 and have a FSH of 27.6 and had a course of 5 treatments of acupuncture and herbs. This resulted in pregnancy. I would recommend Hye-Eun to anyone trying to conceive. I only wished I had known about her sooner&quot; - Maria</span></p>
                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I have suffered for many years with <strong>migraines</strong> and <strong>headaches</strong> with prescribed preventative medication not helping but just causing side effects. My GP and a friend talked to me about accupuncture and to be honest I was feeling pretty desperate that I thought I would give anything a go. I am so glad I did. It wasn't as scary as I thought thanks to Hye-Eun's caring, professional approach. Not only have I had a significant improvement in my headaches/migraines, I am also <strong>sleeping bette</strong>r and have a less frequent menstrual cycle! I know there is some way to go and it is important to maintain these changes but I am very grateful for the calm, efficient care you have shown me&quot; - Lynne</span>                          </p>
                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I went to see Hye-Eun when I recently had surgery to remove an<strong> ectopic pregnancy</strong> and was diagnosed with <strong>Endometriosis</strong>. I was fearful that I wouldn't be able to conceive again and that if I did it would be another ectopic. The surgeon told me there was a high probability that this might happen. After the first couple of sessions with Hye-Eun I became pregnant with my now 6 month old baby boy.<br />
I continued to see  Hye-Eun throughout my pregnancy, she was lovely! Very kind and a good listener.<br />
I always felt great after a session, all my worries put to rest. I just wanted to say a massive thank you to  Hye-Eun...Thank you, thank you, thank you!&quot; - Vicky</span></p>
                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;Two years ago I read an article on acupuncture. It told the story of one lady's attempt to find an answer to a<strong> skin problem</strong>. This made me think, could acupuncture help me. For as long as I can remember I had always suffered with a really red face (<strong>Rosacea</strong>) and constant <strong>spots</strong>. I had known of Hye-Eun through a friend who had helped her with back problems. I made the appointment and have never looked back. I no longer suffer with high colour, spots are a thing of the past and acupuncture has helped in many other ways. Treating the whole body creates better wellbeing. Even to lessening<strong> veins in my legs</strong>, the result of having to stand for several hours each day. Hye-Eun is also treating me for<strong> dry-eye</strong>. The<br />
                            result is amazing, far less soreness and irritation. I am only using eye drops occasionally.<br />
                            Hye-Eun is a pleasure to visit on each and every appointment. I think she is wonderful.&quot; - Marion</span></p>
                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;After fracturing my hip in December of last year I was in considerable<strong> pain in my hip, back, and knee</strong>.  A friend recommended Hye-Eun and her caring impeccable professionalism made a great deal of difference to me during difficult months.  I cannot imagine a better acupuncturist.  The needles, which I feared initially, seemed to glide in so smoothly under her skilled hands, that the experience was not at all uncomfortable. Meanwhile the depth of the questions she asked and the real sense I got of her care for my painful body gave me great  solace in another, valuable way. Week by wek I improved, and though one can never know for certain, I am pretty convinced that the acupuncture was invaluable and hastened my recovery.  Thank you Hye-Eun.&quot; -  Christine</span></p>

                          <p class="sidebar_t">&quot;I am still not sure how to pronounce this super talented therapist's name, but I can assure you that I know how to appreciate her intelligent and empathetic nature - not to mention her superb skills. My baby was still <strong>breech</strong> in week 36 and suddenly realizing that this means a planned caesarian in the UK (unlike in Denmark where I am from) I totally panicked, however by chance of luck I walked past the clinic and received a treatment from Hye-Eun. Our beautiful baby turned that very night, and both me and my husband are deeply grateful. Hye-Eun has a way of oozing that she has all the time in the world for you and she really really listens. Not just with her ears, but with all her astute senses. I can highly recommend her&quot; - Maj </p>

                          <p class="sidebar_t">&quot;Hye-Eun is a very special healer. I started seeing her 5 1/2 years ago as I was in constant pain from <strong>fibromyalgia</strong> and was struggling with <strong>stress</strong> and <strong>depression</strong>. Hye-Eun has helped me to manage my pain and after each session I always feel an inner peace. She has also helped me through 2 <strong>pregnancies</strong>. I highly recommend her!&quot; - Tanya</p>

                          <p class="sidebar_t">&quot;Alongside successful treatment for <strong>fertility</strong>, Hye-Eun did a session of <strong>facial</strong> <strong>acupuncture</strong> for me when I completely broke out a week before my wedding. I was sceptical as to whether one session would make any difference but after 24 hours my skin already looked so much better and by the time our wedding came around I was spot free! Thank you so much. I felt so much better on the day because of it.&quot; - Emma</p>

                          <p class="sidebar_t">&quot;After my acupuncture yesterday, I went to hospital for monitoring. The doctors wanted to keep me in and induce me on a drip because of infection risk which would have meant even a waterbirth would be impossible. But luckily (and I think it's mostly thanks to you) my contractions got started while I was in hospital, so they gave me 2 hours grace at home to make<strong> progress in my labour</strong>, otherwise I'd have no choice but induction. </p>
                          <p class="sidebar_t">The contractions increased at home and a beautiful little boy was born this morning at 2.43am in my birthing pool. Safely and serenely at home relaxed to music and candle light with my loving boyfriend and some gas and air, all just as I dreamed. Thank you so much for your attention&quot; - Rachel</p>

                          <p class="sidebar_t">&quot;I'd<strong> slept badly </strong>for years, and now the problem's gone. It really has changed my life. She's wonderful.&quot; - Louise</p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;Wow, it is just magic. Hye-Eun's healing with needles is very powerful and I realised that if I go as soon as I feel something coming up my way, Hye-Eun can divert it.<br />
What was inevitable before (like having a sore throat at this time of the year), now is just a vague rememberance.&quot; - Sandra</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I had tried other treatments for my <strong>sciatica</strong> before coming here, but this has been a revelation. I would never have believed it possible in just 4 sessions - it's changed my life&quot;- Liz </span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;It's been really brilliant for 5months old Jenson's <strong>urticaria</strong>. I could literally see the difference as his rash disappeared within minutes.&quot; - Sarah</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;Just wanted to thank you for the treatments you gave me to encourage my<strong> labour to start</strong> (I was approaching the <strong>42 weeks </strong>mark). I am happy to say my waters broke that night of the acupuncture treatment and continued to leak for 3 days before Theo arrived, at home, in 3 hrs! So you definitely helped me. Thank you so much!&quot; - Sofie</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I'm very happy to recommend Hye-Eun. Everyone says how much better I look, and it's been so quick.&quot; - Caroline</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I was amazed with the almost immediate <strong>disappearance of pain in my shoulder joint</strong> combined with considerably increased movement. It felt like WD40 was sprayed.&quot; -Nick</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;I am feeling SO much better - my head started to clear Saturday afternoon and this morning I woke up feeling full of the joys of Spring!  I can't tell you how grateful I am.</span><span class="sidebar_t">&quot; </span><span class="sidebar_t">- Sue</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;The treatment with Hye-Eun was amazing - for the first time yesterday I was<strong> pain-free</strong>. And my friends have all been saying I look really well! &quot;- Jane</span></p>
<p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;Thank you Hye-Eun for your kind treatment and your expertise. Every time afterwards I can hope I will get better.&quot; </span><span class="sidebar_t">- Franzisa</span></p>
                          <p class="sidebar_head"><span class="sidebar_t">&quot;Thank you very much for the care and patience you had with me today.<br />
                            I know my fear of needles doesn't help very much when I am having an acupuncture session. I feel so much better now. Thank you!&quot; - Alvaro</span>                          </p>
